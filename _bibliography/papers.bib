  abstract = {Target-speaker speech recognition aims to recognize the speech of an enrolled speaker from an environment with background noise and interfering speakers. This study presents a joint framework that combines time-domain target speaker extraction and recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) for speech recognition. To alleviate the adverse effects of residual noise and artifacts introduced by the target speaker extraction module to the speech recognition back-end, we explore to training the target speaker extraction and RNN-T jointly. We find a multi-stage training strategy that pre-trains and fine-tunes each module before joint training is crucial in stabilizing the training process. In addition, we propose a novel neural uncertainty estimation that leverages useful information from the target speaker extraction module to further improve the back-end speech recognizer (i.e., speaker identity uncertainty and speech enhancement uncertainty). Compared to a recognizer with target speech extraction front-end, our experiments show that joint-training and the neural uncertainty module reduce 7% and 17% relative character error rate (CER) on multi-talker simulation data, respectively. The multi-condition experiments indicate that our method can reduce 9% relative CER in the noisy condition without losing performance in the clean condition. We also observe consistent improvements in further evaluation of real-world data based on vehicular speech.}

  abstract={This paper introduces a new open source platform for end-to-end speech processing named ESPnet. ESPnet mainly focuses on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), and adopts widely-used dynamic neural network toolkits, Chainer and PyTorch, as a main deep learning engine. ESPnet also follows the Kaldi ASR toolkit style for data processing, feature extraction/format, and recipes to provide a complete setup for speech recognition and other speech processing experiments. This paper explains a major architecture of this software platform, several important functionalities, which differentiate ESPnet from other open source ASR toolkits, and experimental results with major ASR benchmarks.},

  abstract={We describe in this paper the experiences of the Johns Hopkins University team during the inaugural DIHARD diarization evaluation. This new task provided microphone recordings in a variety of difficult conditions and challenged researchers to fully consider all speaker activity, without the currently typical practices of unscored collars or ignored overlapping speaker segments. This paper explores several key aspects of currently state-of-the-art diarization methods, such as training data selection, signal bandwidth for feature extraction, representations of speech segments (i-vector versus x-vector) and domain-adaptive processing. In the end, our best system clustered x-vector embeddings trained on wideband microphone data followed by Variational-Bayesian refinement and a speech activity detector specifically trained for this task with in-domain data was found to be the best performing. After presenting these decisions and their final result, we discuss lessons learned and remaining challenges within the lens of this new approach to diarization performance measurement.},
