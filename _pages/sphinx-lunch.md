Welcome to the Sphinx Lunch at Carnegie Mellon University!
This lunch meeting is designed to discuss any speech-related research items regularly.
The meeting consists of the presentation by CMU faculties, CMU students, and guest speakers.
We welcome any reserach topics, including an ordinary presentation, conference presentation rehearsals, preliminary research ideas, research discussions, and so on.
We also welcome any CMU researchers and external researchers to join the meeting.

During the semester, we will regularly have the meeting in the following slot:
- Date: Thursdays 12:30pm - 1:30pm
- Room: GHC 6721
The time and room may change, especially if we have a guest speaker.
We will announce the talk information through our mailing list ([Sphinxmail: Speech Group at Carnegie Mellon](https://mailman.srv.cs.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/sphinxmail). Approval by admin is required).
So, please subscribe to it if you're interested in the CMU speech!
