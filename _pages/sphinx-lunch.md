Welcome to the Sphinx Lunch at Carnegie Mellon University!
This lunch meeting is designed to discuss any speech-related research items regularly.
The meeting consists of the presentation by CMU faculties, CMU students, and guest speakers.
We welcome any reserach topics, including an ordinary presentation, conference presentation rehearsals, preliminary research ideas, research discussions, and so on.
We also welcome any CMU researchers and external researchers to join the meeting.

During the semester, we will regularly have the meeting in the following slot:

- Date: Thursdays 12:30pm - 1:30pm
- Room: GHC 6721

The time and room may change, especially if we have a guest speaker.
We will announce the talk information through our mailing list ([Sphinxmail: Speech Group at Carnegie Mellon](https://mailman.srv.cs.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/sphinxmail). Approval by admin is required).

## Previous Talks

- June 16, 2022
  - Title: Language Technology for Medical Scribing
  - Speaker: Thomas Schaaf (3M \| M\*Modal)
  - Abstract: For many reasons, physicians document what they are doing. In the past, they have used handwritten or dictated notes. With the introduction of EHR systems, the complexity of the documentation workflow has increased, leading to frustration and burnout. Medical asynchronous scribes can do the data entry and note-taking for physicians from an audio recording of the conversation between the physician and the patient. Scribes can be supported with Language Technology using a pipeline of speaker diarization, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. This enables them to asynchronously navigate the audio and review extracted dictated sections or abstractive summaries of the conversation.
  - Bio: Thomas Schaaf is a Principal Research Scientist at 3M \| M\*Modal. He received his Dr. Ing. from the Universit√§t Karlsruhe in 2004 and has been working on Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech Translation, and Natural Language Understanding at Sony Europe, Carnegie Mellon University, Toshiba Europe, Amazon, and M\*Modal. He has worked on nearly all aspects of speech recognition systems,and his research has contributed, among others, to the prediction of word confidences, detection and learning of out-of-vocabulary words, and speaker normalization. He joined 3M in 2019 through the acquisition of M*Modal. There, his research focuses on understanding doctor-patient conversations to reduce the burden of the documentation process for doctors and create more time to care. He is also Adjunct Faculty at the Language Technology Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and a reviewer for numerous conferences and journals.
