  - Title: Unifying Speech Processing Applications with Speech Foundation Models
  - Speaker: Shinji Watanabe
  - Abstract: After the success of large language models in natural language processing, the field of speech processing is currently exploring the possibility of combining speech and language modalities to create a foundation model. This single unified model could perform multiple speech processing applications, such as speech recognition, synthesis, translation, and spoken language processing. Our group is dedicated to achieving this goal through the development of speech foundation models, including speech/text decoder-only models, whisper-style multi-tasking, universal spoken language understanding, and multilingual SUPERB projects. In addition to showcasing the above research outcomes during this talk, we will describe the engineering efforts involved in building such a large foundation model from scratch on an academic computing scale for reproducibility.

  - Title: Universal Speech Enhancement: What Can We Do With Real Data?
  - Speaker: Wangyou Zhang
  - Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) methods based on deep learning have shown impressive performance on many simulation conditions (TIMIT/WSJ/Librispeech/...+Noise), whereas the generalization to a wider range of real conditions has not been addressed. In fact, many high-performing SE methods tend to overfit the simulation condition in training, whose inductive bias may be easily violated in real conditions. In the era of large-scale pre-training, it is natural to ask whether we can make use of the large-scale real recording data to train a truly universal SE model that can be used for all speech-as-input tasks in real-world conditoins. In this talk, I try to answer the following two questions by summarizing exisiting works on these directions: 1) what can we do to utilize real data for SE training? 2) what models can be used to achieve universal SE? Finally, I will finish the talk by proposing new problems in the related topics.

- November 2, 2023
  - Title: Music generation with precise control
  - Speakers: Chris Donahue and Shih-Lun Wu
  - Abstract: In the first half of the session, Chris will discuss some recent work on generating music with precise control and composable outputs. Music audio generation has seen an explosion of activity - we now have the ability to generate music in broad styles with natural language control. However, despite the impressive breadth of these models, they have not yet had a salient impact on music in the real world. Instead, music AI models with more narrow capabilities have had disproportionate impact (e.g. source separation, voice cloning). In this talk, Chris will argue that current narrow models are more appealing to creators because they offer more creative potential for two reasons: (i) they offer precise and familiar forms of control, and (ii) their outputs are composable and integrate with conventional workflows. Chris will discuss two of his recent papers, SingSong (Donahue+ 23) and the Anticipatory Music Transformer (Thickstun+ 23) which seek to bring more creative potential to broadly-capable music generative models. In the second half of the session, Shih-Lun will introduce his recent work, Music ControlNet (Wu+ 23, unpublished), which imbues diffusion-based text-to-music generation models with precise melody, dynamics, and rhythm controls. Music ControlNet builds upon the ControlNet line of research in image generation, and adapts their framework to accept time-varying controls in audio domain. Shih-Lun will demonstrate that Music ControlNet can respond precisely to any composition of the controls it has been trained on, and can also generalize to out-of-distribution control signals that creators may realistically provide.

  - Title: Computational Audition through Imprecise labels
  - Speaker: Ankit Shah
  - Abstract: In this talk, we delve into computational auditory processing to mimic how humans and animals interpret sounds to interact with their surroundings effectively. The journey begins with the machine's challenge to recognize a vast array of sounds limited by the known sounds in our datasets. This limitation becomes glaring as current models require large labeled datasets for accuracy, which often isn't feasible in real-world settings due to data scarcity. We then spotlight core issues: the strength of sound labels within available datasets. The quandary is that even with a fraction of known sounds and limited data, inaccuracies in sound labeling lead to suboptimal models. Our focus shifts to devising strategies for sound modeling amidst inaccurate, weak or incomplete labels, termed as working with imprecise labeled data. Our exploration includes enhancing the existing annotations, understanding the effects of label noise and corruption, and innovating a co-training approach for learning sound events from web data without human intervention. We venture into exploiting additional cues like event counts and durations with negligible extra effort, introducing the concept of semi-weak labels. Lastly, the talk describes a unified framework encapsulating all our approaches, making a robust model capable of handling various labeling scenarios, paving a solid foundation for future endeavors in understanding and modeling the world of images (transferrable to sounds), irrespective of label availability. Through this, we aspire to bridge the gap between the human brain's natural sound-processing ability and machines, opening doors to a more harmonious interaction with the acoustic world around us.

  - Title: Adaptive Non-Causality for Speech Recognition
  - Speaker: Grant Strimel (Amazon)
  - Abstract: Streaming speech recognition architectures are employed for low-latency, real-time applications. Such architectures are often characterized by their causality – how much forward context is consumed before making a prediction on an individual frame. In this talk we will review prior approaches to balance competing objectives of low latency and the accuracy benefit derived from “look ahead” information. We then will discuss an approach we proposed called the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT). The architecture is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with novel regularization algorithms (which we will dive into) , delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their fully-causal model counterparts.

  - Title: Towards robust speech generation
  - Speaker: Soumi Maiti

- August 31, 2023
  - Title: Solving problems of a single-modal task with multi-modality
  - Speaker: Minsu Kim (KAIST)
  - Abstract: Speech processing technologies include diverse tasks with diverse modalities such as Audio-based Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), Text-to- Speech, Lip-to-Speech, Speech-driven talking face generation, etc. People usually utilize the modalities corresponding to the task at hand when developing a technology. For example, if we develop a VSR model, we usually utilize video and text modalities without considering other modalities (e.g., audio). In this talk, I will show some examples which try to solve a challenge of a single-modal task with multimodal data. They include the cases of employing 1) other modality containing rich task knowledge, 2) correspondence of multimodality, and 3) useful characteristics of different modalities. Finally, we can realize that numerous research opportunities emerge upon exploring various multimodal options pertinent to our current task.

  - Title: How to best leverage unlabeled data for speech recognition?
  - Speaker: Dan Berrebbi
  - Abstract: For speech recognition (ASR) as for most machine learning fields, labeled data is very expensive to get and so is far less abundant than unlabeled data. Leveraging untranscribed audio data is thus critical to build strong ASR models. Self-supervised models (SSL) such as wav2vec2.0 or HuBERT, pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled data with pretext tasks, seem to perfectly respond to that need. Indeed, even when fine-tuned on very small amounts of transcribed speech data, they outperform previous supervised work as well as human performances on LibriSpeech dataset (which is the reference ASR benchmark) by a large margin. However those models can perform badly in case of domain shifts. Moreover we do not really know how to efficiently fine-tune them, or use them for inference. We also do not know well how to benchmark, evaluate or compare them. Finally their pre-training is very hard to reproduce and so finding alternative ways to leverage unlabeled data is of broad interest. In this talk we will tackle the following questions : 1) How to efficiently use speech SSL models for ASR? 2) How to adapt them in domain-shift scenarios? 3) How to efficiently evaluate and benchmark such models? 4) Can some alternative unsupervised training methods such as semi-supervised learning outperform SSL models? This talk is gathering our recent publications at Interspeech 2022 & 2023, ICASSP 2023 and ICLR 2023.

  - Title: Audio-Visual Learning for Social Telepresence
  - Speaker: Alexander Richard (Meta)
  - Abstract: These days, physical distance between people is one of the biggest obstacles to maintaining meaningful social relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Even with today’s technology, remote communication is limited to a two-dimensional audio-visual experience and lacks the availability of a shared, three-dimensional space in which people can interact with each other over the distance. Our mission at Reality Labs Research (RLR) in Pittsburgh is to develop a telepresence system that is indistinguishable from reality, i.e., a system that provides photo- and phono-realistic social interactions in VR. Building such a system requires a leap forward in audio modeling: 3D virtual spaces call for highly realistic 3D spatial audio rendering and immersive experiences demand to strip a user’s input audio from all environmental influences such as noise and reverb. Addressing the first problem, I will talk about building neural renderers for spatial audio from capture stage design to model development. For the latter problem, I will present an approach to speech enhancement that is based on a codify-and-resynthesize paradigm. In the future, these technologies will help build a realistic virtual environment with lifelike avatars that allow for authentic social interactions, connecting people all over the world, anywhere and at any time.

He received his PhD from the University of Bonn for his work on temporal segmentation of human actions in videos.

  - Title: End-to-End Speech Summarization: Global Acoustic Context
  - Speaker: Roshan Sharma
  - Abstract: Speech in the real world is verbose, and humans possess the special ability to recognize what is being said, understand it, and consequently summarize speech. Automatic methods for speech summarization are crucial to imbue such capabilities in the artificial intelligence of tomorrow. Current methods for speech summarization involve a cascade of speech recognition and transcript summarization, which suffer from error propagation and larger model sizes. We proposed training speech summarization models end-to-end and demonstrated that such models outperform cascade summarization approaches. Speech summarization becomes more complex as the input length increases to a few minutes or half an hour. In this talk, we address the challenge of efficient and performant training for long audio summarization.

  - Title: Continual Learning in Speech and Audio Applications
  - Speaker: Muqiao Yang
  - Abstract: The outstanding performance of deep neural networks typically relies on the training on a large fixed set of data. However, in practical applications, the properties of data streams may vary over time and the model may have limited access to past data, where the model performance will be affected due to the catastrophic forgetting effect. In this talk, we will focus on multiple Speech and Audio tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition, Acoustic Scene Classification and Spoken Language Understanding and investigate how different continual learning scenarios and methods work under such settings.

  - Title: Reference Free Learning for Speech Enhancement and Speech Assessment
  - Speaker: Anurag Kumar (Meta)
  - Abstract: Improving perceptual quality and intelligibility of speech signals is critical for improving communications in real and virtual world. This is needed for people with normal hearing as well as those who have some form of hearing impairments.  In this talk, I will present an outline of some of my recent research on both methods to enhance degraded speech as well as methods for speech assessment.  I will go in depth of our recent works on unsupervised and self-supervised approaches for speech enhancement and how speech signals from the wild – for which target signal are not available - might be used for enhancement. These approaches enable easier adaptation to out of domain conditions as well as opens up the possibility of on-the-fly adaptation of enhancement systems. I will also present reference-less approaches for speech quality and intelligibility assessment - in particular the NORESQA framework which introduced a new way of non-intrusive speech assessment by leveraging non-matching references.

  - Title: Adversarial robustness of modern speech recognition models: evaluation and implications
  - Speaker: Raphael Olivier
  - Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Machine Learning models are small perturbations of inputs which fool models into predicting the wrong outputs. In numerous real-world settings they are known to be the source of potential security liabilities. In this work we study the implications of these adversarial attacks when applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. Our main finding is that the recent progress in ASR performance has led to an increase in adversarial vulnerability, rather than an improvement in robustness . We illustrate two aspects of this phenomenon. First, even models like Whisper with state-of-the-art robustness to random noise and domain change show no significant adversarial robustness improvement, while their increased adoption makes threat models more realistic. Second, we show that popular ASR training paradigms like Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have opened the way to new threat models like transferred adversarial attacks from a proxy model. We draw conclusions from those results, emphasizing the importance to include adversarial robustness in speech modeling pipelines from a security perspective, but also the interest of adversarial evaluation in better understanding those new learning paradigms.

  - Speaker: Xuankai Chang

However, ASR systems often encounter challenges in complex settings caused by background noise, reverberations, overlapping speech, etc. In this talk, we present our efforts towards recognizing everyday conversations using End-to-End neural networks. Our approach tackles the issue of noise and overlapping speech by leveraging single- and multi-channel signals.

  - Title: Multi-blank Transducers for Speech Recognition
  - Speaker: Hainan Xu (NVIDIA)
  - Abstract: We propose a modification to RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In standard RNN-T, the emission of a blank symbol consumes exactly one input frame; in our proposed method, we introduce additional blank symbols, which consume two or more input frames when emitted. We refer to the added symbols as big blanks, and the method multi-blank RNN-T. For training multi-blank RNN-Ts, we propose a novel logit under-normalization method in order to prioritize emissions of big blanks. With experiments on multiple languages and datasets, we show that multi-blank RNN-T methods could bring relative speedups of over +90%/+139% to model inference for English Librispeech and German Multilingual Librispeech datasets, respectively. The multi-blank RNN-T method also improves ASR accuracy consistently. We will release our implementation of the method in the [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/) toolkit.

  - Title: Towards robust audio-visual learning
  - Speaker: Billy Li
  - Abstract: Audio Visual Event Detection has benefited greatly from the advancement of deep learning in the past few years. Various model architectures have been applied to the task in multiple modalities, pushing the performance benchmark and enabling the deployment of such models in many critical tasks such as surveillance and malicious content filtering. However, the research community still lacks: 1) a systematic understanding of the different machine learning models' behavior given the unique nature of audio signals compared to the image or text counterparts. 2) The robustness of different models used for audio-visual learning also remains to be an under-studied area. To address the first point, we investigate best practices for building an audio-only and audio-visual learning system that performs well. Specifically, we analyze the features, compare different architectures, mainly focusing on convolutional family and Transformer family models, and understand the difference in training techniques to provide a comprehensive and thorough understanding. To address the second goal, we study the robustness of each model by gauging their behavior under noise and adversarial perturbation. We first demonstrate the existence of real-world threats in both the visual and audio domains. We then expand our scope of robustness analysis from unimodal audio input to multiple modalities including audio, video, image and text.

  - Title: Self-supervised speech restoration for historical audio
  - Speaker: Takaaki Saeki
  - Abstract: Existing historical audio materials are precious resources that contain various linguistic and cultural information. However, restoring or analyzing such audio data is challenging because paired high-quality and degraded speech data is not available. In this talk, we present our recent work on self-supervised speech restoration for historical audio. Our model is based on an autoencoder, which disentangles distortionless speech features from acoustic distortions and is trained only with degraded speech data by simulating the recording process. We evaluated our method with real historical audio data and demonstrated the effectiveness. I will also discuss the ongoing work and future directions including larger-scale self-supervised learning by collecting various historical audio materials.

  - Title: Recent Progresses in All-Neural Contextual Speech Recognition Technologies at Amazon Alexa
  - Speaker: Jing Liu (Amazon)
  - Abstract: Speech recognition technology is completing a dramatic shift from the conventional disjointly trained neural and non-neural sub-systems to an all-neural end-to-end (E2E) transducer architecture. This unified all-neural E2E architecture improves the state-of-the-art accuracy, while also achieving superior compute and memory compression, enabling low-latency streaming ASR on the edge where resources are constrained. One of the major challenges for E2E ASR systems is that they often have difficulty recognizing uncommon words that appear infrequently in the training data (e.g. personalized contact names, device names). In this talk, I will give an overview of the challenges and our recent progresses in the all-neural contextual ASR technology that powers Alexa, the virtual voice assistant that servers millions of customers daily.

  - Title: [Compositional End-to-End SLU]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2022-11-17_siddhant.pdf)
  - Speaker: Siddhant Arora
  - Abstract: End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) systems are gaining popularity over cascaded approaches due to their simplicity and ability to avoid error propagation. However, these systems model sequence labeling as a sequence prediction task causing a divergence from its well-established token-level tagging formulation. In work accepted at EMNLP 2022, we build compositional end-to-end SLU systems that explicitly separate the added complexity of recognizing spoken mentions in SLU from the NLU task of sequence labeling. We show that this composition of ASR and NLU formulations in our end-to-end SLU system outperforms both cascaded and direct end-to-end models, offers direct compatibility with pre-trained ASR and NLU systems, allows performance monitoring of individual components and enables the use of globally normalized losses like CRF, making them attractive in practical scenarios.

  - Title: Robot Concept Learning in Situated Dialogue
  - Speaker: Matthew Marge
  - Abstract: Intelligent agents that refer to and make use of the physical world, like robots, will be more able to adapt to new situations if they can learn concepts in real time from humans.

Key accomplishments include (1) an improved understanding of how humans teach robots compared to other humans, (2) a first-of-its-kind corpus of questions that robots can use to learn from human teachers, and (3) real-time algorithms that enable robots to generate questions that maximize learning in a cognitive robotic architecture. The end result is the novel capability for intelligent agents to use situated dialogue and one-shot learning to acquire more information about their surroundings with human teammates.

  - Title: [Audio Visual Recognition and Understanding]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2022-09-29_Karthik.pdf)
  - Speaker: Karthik Ganesan
  - Abstract: Streaming audio-visual speech recognition (SAVSR) introduces an online setting to audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), which frees the full utterance requirement prior to decoding that traditional speech recognition models are limited to. Streaming audio-visual speech recognition further challenges the model leaving itself to decide how much the model should wait to have retrieved enough information to start decoding. While transformer based models such as AvHuBERT have been successful in AVSR tasks through pretraining and cross-modal interactions, these models suffer in achieving reasonable Real-Time Factor (RTF) which is necessary for communication agents. We propose ESPnet Mulimodal, a multimodal frame work integrated to ESPnet, and provide baseline results for the task SAVSR. We also propose a streaming transformer. and multimodal fusion based model for SAVSR. Through ESPnet Mulitmodal, we expect to facilitate research in the field of audio-visual tasks including SAVSR.

Recently, with the help of self-supervised learning, end-to-end unsupervised ASR has become possible and has shown impressive performances. This talk goes through some of our efforts from the pre-training team, [JSALT2022](https://jsalt-2022-ssl.github.io/), including some experiences in end-to-end unsupervised ASR and its extended usages in self-supervised augmentation, acoustic segmentation, and connection between modalities. We will also discuss some ongoing open-source works.

  - Title: [Is everything end-to-end?]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2022-09-01-shinji.pdf)
  - Speaker: Shinji Watanabe (CMU)
  - Abstract: This presentation introduces some of our group's recent attempts at making an end-to-end network that integrates various speech processing modules as a single neural network. I'll talk about ASR (feature extraction, acoustic modeling, lexicons, language modeling), far-field conversation recognition (ASR + denoising/dereverberation/separation (+ diarization)), and cycle consistency training (ASR + SID + TTS). I will introduce some random thoughts about these attempts and also discuss future integration ideas.

  - Title: [An Unified Understanding of Voice Conversion and its Medical Application]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2022-08-08-voice_conversion.pdf)
  - Speaker: Wen-Chin Huang (Nagoya University)
  - Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) is the task of converting one kind of speech to another without changing the linguistic contents, and is the second most popular research field in speech synthesis. With the rise of deep neural networks, there are more and more VC methods being proposed each year, and it might be hard to understand the difference of these methods at first sight. In this talk, I will provide my own, unified understanding of VC, and show that how most successful VC methods implement the same underlying framework. I will also introduce my recent works on dysarthric VC, as a showcase of an application of VC to medicine.
  - Bio: Wen-Chin Huang is currently a Ph.D. candidate at Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. He received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2018 and the M.S. degree from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan in 2021.

  - Title: Language Technology for Medical Scribing
  - Speaker: Thomas Schaaf (3M \| M\*Modal)
  - Abstract: For many reasons, physicians document what they are doing. In the past, they have used handwritten or dictated notes. With the introduction of EHR systems, the complexity of the documentation workflow has increased, leading to frustration and burnout. Medical asynchronous scribes can do the data entry and note-taking for physicians from an audio recording of the conversation between the physician and the patient. Scribes can be supported with Language Technology using a pipeline of speaker diarization, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. This enables them to asynchronously navigate the audio and review extracted dictated sections or abstractive summaries of the conversation.
  - Bio: Thomas Schaaf is a Principal Research Scientist at 3M \| M\*Modal. He received his Dr. Ing. from the Universität Karlsruhe in 2004 and has been working on Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech Translation, and Natural Language Understanding at Sony Europe, Carnegie Mellon University, Toshiba Europe, Amazon, and M\*Modal. He has worked on nearly all aspects of speech recognition systems,and his research has contributed, among others, to the prediction of word confidences, detection and learning of out-of-vocabulary words, and speaker normalization. He joined 3M in 2019 through the acquisition of M\*Modal. There, his research focuses on understanding doctor-patient conversations to reduce the burden of the documentation process for doctors and create more time to care. He is also Adjunct Faculty at the Language Technology Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and a reviewer for numerous conferences and journals.

  - Title: Directions of Dialog Research in the Era of Big Pre-training Models
  - Speaker: Zhou Yu (Columbia University)
  - Abstract: Big pre-training models (such as BERT and GPT3) have demonstrated excellent performances on various NLP tasks. Instruction tuning and prompting have enabled these models to shine in low-resource settings. The natural question is “Will big models solve dialog tasks?” This talk will first go through big models’ impact on several sub-topics within dialog systems (e.g. social chatbots, task-oriented dialog systems, negotiation/persuasion dialog systems, continue learning in dialog systems, multilingual dialog systems, multimodal dialog systems, deployable dialog systems, etc) and then follow up with the speaker's own interpretations of the challenges remaining and possible future directions.
  - Bio: Zhou Yu joined the CS department at Columbia University in Jan 2021 as an Assistant Professor ([http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/)). Before that, she was an Assistant Professor at UC Davis. She obtained her Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017. Zhou has built various dialog systems that have a real impact, such as a job interview training system, a depression screening system, and a second language learning system. Her research interests include dialog systems, language understanding and generation, vision and language, human-computer interaction, and social robots. Zhou received an ACL 2019 best paper nomination, featured in Forbes 2018 30 under 30 in Science, and won the 2018 Amazon Alexa Prize.
