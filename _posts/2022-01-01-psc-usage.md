## Step by step starting towards successful ssh login 
- Look for guide with some screenshots above

1. Create an account for [ACCESS](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user)
    - This account is used for both PSC and Delta
    - When you create, [Register with an existing identity](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user-federated). Don't do Register without an existing identity.

2. Send the username to allocation managers (e.g. Xuankai) to add the user in our group.
    - After this step is done, you should be able to see `list of resources` at https://allocations.access-ci.org
    - To see the `list of resources`, log-in with identity provider `Carnegie Mellon University`

3. Initialise your PSC password (used for ssh login)
    - Go to https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide-2-2/ and click `PSC Password Change Utility`
    - **It may take few hours** for your `username` and `email` to be recognised, even if they're correct.

4. Access via ssh
    - ssh [username]@[resource_dir]
      - E.g., `jjung1@bridges2.psc.edu`
    - Use the password you initialised in step 3.

# Important
1. `Home` directory is of limited space. Please do most of your work in ocean storage (`$ cd ${PROJECT}`)
2. When you publish a paper, please **acknowledge the PSC and ACCESS**. We will get benefit when we apply for PSC credits next time.

## GPU Partitions
* In `GPU / GPU-shared` partitions, each node consists of 8 v100 GPU devices
* There are two types of GPU nodes: `v100-16` and `v100-32` having GPU units with 16GB and 32GB memory respectively.
* Submit jobs to `GPU-shared` partition. (**Recommended**)
  * Using `-p GPU-shared --gpus=type:n` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `type` can be `v100-16` or `v100-32` and `n` can range from 1 to 4 (1 is recommended).
* Submit jobs to `GPU` partition.
  * **Please use it only when necessary.**
  * Using `-p GPU` in `sbatch` or `srun`. It request to allocate a whole GPU node, 8 GPUs, for each job.
  * In this case, it deducts 8 SUs from our team's GPU allocation every hour the job runs.
* **Good Practice: Usually, users are strongly recommended to use `GPU-shared` partition and allocate 1 GPU only for each job.**
  * When allocating multiple GPUs, you usually need to wait much longer time.
  * Single-GPU jobs are more efficient than multi-GPU ones: the latter will have communication overhead.
  * Multi-GPU jobs will be allowed only when (1) the users have been familiar with the cluster and (2) the project really needs that resource. Beginners are strongly discouraged from trying this option.
  * Please avoid using `GPU` partition by mistake: it makes the allocated GPUs idle and causes much waste to our resources.
  * We will periodically check each user's usage and send a reminder when necessary.

## RM Partitions (For CPU Jobs)
* In the `RM and RM-512` partitions, each node consists of 128 cores. 
* Nodes in RM, RM-shared partitions have a memory of 128GB, while nodes in RM-512 partitions have 512GB memory.
* using an entire node for an hour will deduct 128 SUs from our team's Regular Memory allocation.
* Submit jobs to `RM-shared` partition. (**suggested**)
  * Using `-p RM-shared --ntasks-per-node=n --mem=2000M` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `n` can range from 1 to 64.
  * Usually, jobs only require a few cpu cores.
* Submit jobs to `RM` partition.
  * **Please use it only when necessary.**
  * It request to allocate all of the 128 cpu cores.
  * Using `-p RM --ntasks-per-node=n` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `n` can range from 1 to 64.
* **Good Practice: Usually, users are strongly recommended to use `RM-shared` partition.**
  * You can adjust the memory allocation of each CPU job, but please bear in mind that CPU is also charged by every 2000M memory allocation. E.g., a CPU core with 4000M memory running 1 hour will also be charged 2SUs.
  * Usage of `RM` or `RM-512` partitions will be allowed only when (1) the users have been familiar with the cluster and (2) the project really needs that resource. Beginners are strongly discouraged from trying this option.
  * Please avoid using `RM` or `RM-512` partitions by mistake: it makes the allocated CPUs idle and causes much waste to our resources.
  * We will periodically check each user's usage and send a reminder when necessary.

## Other usage
* Data copying / file transfer
  * Suggest to use `data.bridges2.psc.edu` as the machine name. Doing file transfer with `rsync`, `sftp`, `scp`, etc. [Transferring Files](https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide-2-2/). Following is an example of `scp`.
    ```
      # This requires the enrollment of Two-Factor Authentication (TFA)
      scp -P 2222 myfile XSEDE-username@data.bridges2.psc.edu:/path/to/file
    ```
 
* Submitting jobs with dependency
  * This can be used to submit a job which is expected to start run after some specific jobs finish. In many cases, training a model can take a few days. However, PSC has the restriction that each job can run for 2 days at most. In this case, we can start a job with dependency for long jobs. For example, you already start a job ID is 000001 and you want a following job right after it. You can submit jobs like:
    ```
      sbatch --time 2-0:00:00 --dependency=afterany:000001 run.sh
    ```
 
* Common arguments in sbatch / srun
  ```
  -p, --partition=partition               partition requested
  -J, --job-name=jobname                  name of job
  -t, --time=time                         time limit
  --gres=rsrc_name[:rsrc_type]:rsrc_num   required generic resources
  -c, --cpus-per-task=ncpus               number of cpus required per task
  -d, --dependency=type:jobid[:time]      defer job until condition on jobid is satisfied
  -e, --error=err                         file for batch script's standard error
  -o, --output=out                        file for batch script's standard output
  --mem-per-cpu=MB                        maximum amount of real memory per allocated
  --ntasks-per-node=n                     number of tasks to invoke on each node
  --reservation=name                      allocate resources from named reservation, e.g. `GPUcis210027`
  ```

## Running an example `an4` recipe with `run.sh` using slurm backend
0. Go the the directory: `cd egs2/an4/asr1`
1. Modify `cmd.sh` and `conf/slurm.conf` to be ready for slurm management
   ```bash
   # cmd.sh

   # line 31
   cmd_backend='slurm'  # cmd_backend='local'
   ```
   ```yaml
   # conf/slurm.conf

   # Default configuration                                                                                                                                                        
   command sbatch --export=PATH
   option name=* --job-name $0
   default time=48:00:00
   option time=* --time $0
   option mem=* --mem-per-cpu $0
   option mem=0
   option num_threads=* --cpus-per-task $0
   option num_threads=1 --cpus-per-task 1
   option num_nodes=* --nodes $0
   default gpu=0
   option gpu=0 -p RM-shared
   option gpu=* -p GPU-shared --gres=gpu:$0 -c $0  # Recommend allocating more CPU than, or equal to the number of GPU
   # note: the --max-jobs-run option is supported as a special case
   # by slurm.pl and you don't have to handle it in the config file.
   ```

2. Run experiments
   ```
   ./run.sh --stage 1 --stop-stage 13
   ```

## Running an example `an4` recipe step by step:
1. Execute the data preparation stages: `-1` and `0`
   * Stage `-1` downloads and un-tars the `an4` dataset with 948 training and 130 test utterances.
   * Stage `0` prepares the dataset by creating `data/train` and `data/test` directories. Names of these directories can vary for other datasets. 
Each of these directories contains 4 files: `wav.scp`, `text`, `utt2spk` and `spk2utt`. 
A mapping from a unique utterance-ID to the utterance's filepath, text and speaker-ID is noted in `wav.scp` , `text`, `utt2spk` files respectively. An inverse mapping from the speaker-ID to the speaker's utterance-IDs is noted in `spk2utt file`.
   ```bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet
   cd egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage -1 --stop_stage 0
   ```
2. Execute the feature extraction stage: `1`
   * Stage `1` extracts the 80 log-mel and 3 pitch features from a 25ms frame shifted every 10ms for each audio sample.
   * Parameter `nj` in this stage's code represents the number of CPUs used to parallelly extract the features.
   * Since this dataset doesn't provide a validation split, we split the 948 training utterances into 848 training and 100 dev samples.
   * A mapping from utterance-IDs to feature filepaths is noted in `data/*/feats.scp` file and extracted features are stored in the `dump/*/deltafalse/feats.{1-$nj}.ark` files.
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --stage 1 --stop_stage 1
   ```
3. Prepare a dictionary and data.json in stage: `2`
   * A mapping of each character, special tokens (ex: <unk>,<space> etc.) to a unique token-ID is stored as a dictionary at `data/lang_1char/train_nodev_units.txt`
   * Pairs of extracted features and mapped tokens (using above dictionary) for each utterance-ID is stored as a JSON file in the respective `dump` directories.
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --stage 2 --stop_stage 2
   ```
4. Train the RNN-LM and ASR models in stages: `3` and `4` 
   * Trained LM models are stored by default in `exp/train_rnnlm_pytorch_lm_word100/` directory
   * Trained ASR models are stored by default in `exp/train_nodev_pytorch_train_mtlalpha1.0/results/` directory
   * Request GPU resources for training:
   ```bash
   sbatch -t 2-00:00:00 -p GPU-shared -N 1 --gpus=v100-16:1 --mem=16G train_model.sh
   ```
   * Preview of `train_model.sh` file to train the RNN based language model (RNN-LM) in stage: `3`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 3 --stop_stage 3
   ```
   * Preview of `train_model.sh` file to train the ASR model in stage: `4`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 4 --stop_stage 4
   ```
5. Request computational resources and perform decoding in stage: `5`
   * Parameter `nj` in this stage's code represents the number of CPUs used to parallelly decode each recognition set: validation, test splits. So we must request 2x`nj` number of CPUs in total.
   * Note that for each CPU, we can request a maximum memory of 2000M.
   * Request RM-shared node resources for decoding:
   ```bash
   sbatch -t 12:00:00 -p RM-shared -N 1 --cpus-per-task=16 --mem=32000M decode_model.sh
   ```
   * Preview of `decode_model.sh` file to decode the ASR model in stage: `5`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 5 --stop_stage 5
   ```
6. Misc.
   * An interrupted training can be resumed by specifying `--resume` parameter with the path to most recent snapshot in `exp/train_nodev_pytorch_train_mtlalpha1.0/results/` directory.
   * A unique tag for managing your experiments can be set by specifying `--lmtag` and `--tag` parameters.
   * Multi-GPU training can be done by specifying `--ngpu` in the training stages.
   * For interactive debugging purposes, `srun` command can be used to request GPU-shared or RM-shared nodes as below. Note that PSC has limited service units (SUs), so use `srun` based debugging for only the required duration.
   ```bash
   srun --pty -p GPU-shared -N 1 --gpus=v100-16:1 /bin/bash -l
   srun --pty -p RM-shared -N 1 --cpus-per-task=16 --mem=32000M /bin/bash -l
   ```
