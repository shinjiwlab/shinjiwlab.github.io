## Account creation
- Create an account for PSC / NCSA on [ACCESS](https://allocations.access-ci.org/)
- Send the username to allocation managers (e.g. Xuankai) to add the user in our group.

## login
* Bridges-2: check https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide-2-2/
* Delta: check https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/DSC/Delta+User+Guide#DeltaUserGuide-DirectAccesslogin_nodes

## GPU Partitions
* In `GPU / GPU-shared` partitions, each node consists of 8 v100 GPU devices
* There are two types of GPU nodes: `v100-16` and `v100-32` having GPU units with 16GB and 32GB memory respectively.
* Submit jobs to `GPU-shared` partition. (**suggested**)
  * Using `-p GPU-shared --gpus=type:n` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `type` can be `v100-16` or `v100-32` and `n` can range from 1 to 4.
* Submit jobs to `GPU` partition.
  * **Please use it only when necessary.**
  * Using `-p GPU` in `sbatch` or `srun`. It request to allocate a whole GPU node, 8 GPUs, for each job.
  * In this case, it deducts 8 SUs from our team's GPU allocation every hour the job runs.

## RM Partitions
* In the `RM and RM-512` partitions, each node consists of 128 cores. 
* Nodes in RM, RM-shared partitions have a memory of 128GB, while nodes in RM-512 partitions have 512GB memory.
* using an entire node for an hour will deduct 128 SUs from our team's Regular Memory allocation.
* Submit jobs to `RM-shared` partition. (**suggested**)
  * Using `-p RM-shared --ntasks-per-node=n` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `n` can range from 1 to 64.
  * Usually, jobs only require a few cpu cores.
* Submit jobs to `RM` partition.
  * **Please use it only when necessary.**
  * It request to allocate all of the 128 cpu cores.
  * Using `-p RM --ntasks-per-node=n` in `sbatch` or `srun`. Here `n` can range from 1 to 64.

## Other usage
* Data copying / file transfer
  * Suggest to use `data.bridges2.psc.edu` as the machine name. Doing file transfer with `rsync`, `sftp`, `scp`, etc. [Transferring Files](https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide-2-2/). Following is an example of `scp`.
    ```
      # This requires the enrollment of Two-Factor Authentication (TFA)
      scp -P 2222 myfile XSEDE-username@data.bridges2.psc.edu:/path/to/file
    ```
 
* Submitting jobs with dependency
  * This can be used to submit a job which is expected to start run after some specific jobs finish. In many cases, training a model can take a few days. However, PSC has the restriction that each job can run for 2 days at most. In this case, we can start a job with dependency for long jobs. For example, you already start a job ID is 000001 and you want a following job right after it. You can submit jobs like:
    ```
      sbatch --time 2-0:00:00 --dependency=afterany:000001 run.sh
    ```
 
* Common arguments in sbatch / srun
  ```
  -p, --partition=partition               partition requested
  -J, --job-name=jobname                  name of job
  -t, --time=time                         time limit
  --gres=rsrc_name[:rsrc_type]:rsrc_num   required generic resources
  -c, --cpus-per-task=ncpus               number of cpus required per task
  -d, --dependency=type:jobid[:time]      defer job until condition on jobid is satisfied
  -e, --error=err                         file for batch script's standard error
  -o, --output=out                        file for batch script's standard output
  --mem-per-cpu=MB                        maximum amount of real memory per allocated
  --ntasks-per-node=n                     number of tasks to invoke on each node
  --reservation=name                      allocate resources from named reservation, e.g. `GPUcis210027`
  ```

## Running an example `an4` recipe with `run.sh` using slurm backend
0. Go the the directory: `cd egs2/an4/asr1`
1. Modify `cmd.sh` and `conf/slurm.conf` to be ready for slurm management
   ```bash
   # cmd.sh

   # line 31
   cmd_backend='slurm'  # cmd_backend='local'
   ```
   ```yaml
   # conf/slurm.conf

   # Default configuration                                                                                                                                                        
   command sbatch --export=PATH
   option name=* --job-name $0
   default time=48:00:00
   option time=* --time $0
   option mem=* --mem-per-cpu $0
   option mem=0
   option num_threads=* --cpus-per-task $0
   option num_threads=1 --cpus-per-task 1
   option num_nodes=* --nodes $0
   default gpu=0
   option gpu=0 -p RM-shared
   option gpu=* -p GPU-shared --gres=gpu:$0 -c $0  # Recommend allocating more CPU than, or equal to the number of GPU
   # note: the --max-jobs-run option is supported as a special case
   # by slurm.pl and you don't have to handle it in the config file.
   ```
2. Run experiments
   ```
   ./run.sh --stage 1 --stop-stage 13
   ```

## Running an example `an4` recipe step by step:
1. Execute the data preparation stages: `-1` and `0`
   * Stage `-1` downloads and un-tars the `an4` dataset with 948 training and 130 test utterances.
   * Stage `0` prepares the dataset by creating `data/train` and `data/test` directories. Names of these directories can vary for other datasets. 
Each of these directories contains 4 files: `wav.scp`, `text`, `utt2spk` and `spk2utt`. 
A mapping from a unique utterance-ID to the utterance's filepath, text and speaker-ID is noted in `wav.scp` , `text`, `utt2spk` files respectively. An inverse mapping from the speaker-ID to the speaker's utterance-IDs is noted in `spk2utt file`.
   ```bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet
   cd egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage -1 --stop_stage 0
   ```
2. Execute the feature extraction stage: `1`
   * Stage `1` extracts the 80 log-mel and 3 pitch features from a 25ms frame shifted every 10ms for each audio sample.
   * Parameter `nj` in this stage's code represents the number of CPUs used to parallelly extract the features.
   * Since this dataset doesn't provide a validation split, we split the 948 training utterances into 848 training and 100 dev samples.
   * A mapping from utterance-IDs to feature filepaths is noted in `data/*/feats.scp` file and extracted features are stored in the `dump/*/deltafalse/feats.{1-$nj}.ark` files.
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --stage 1 --stop_stage 1
   ```
3. Prepare a dictionary and data.json in stage: `2`
   * A mapping of each character, special tokens (ex: <unk>,<space> etc.) to a unique token-ID is stored as a dictionary at `data/lang_1char/train_nodev_units.txt`
   * Pairs of extracted features and mapped tokens (using above dictionary) for each utterance-ID is stored as a JSON file in the respective `dump` directories.
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --stage 2 --stop_stage 2
   ```
4. Train the RNN-LM and ASR models in stages: `3` and `4` 
   * Trained LM models are stored by default in `exp/train_rnnlm_pytorch_lm_word100/` directory
   * Trained ASR models are stored by default in `exp/train_nodev_pytorch_train_mtlalpha1.0/results/` directory
   * Request GPU resources for training:
   ```bash
   sbatch -t 2-00:00:00 -p GPU-shared -N 1 --gpus=v100-16:1 --mem=16G train_model.sh
   ```
   * Preview of `train_model.sh` file to train the RNN based language model (RNN-LM) in stage: `3`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   module load cuda/10.2.0 cudnn mkl
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 3 --stop_stage 3
   ```
   * Preview of `train_model.sh` file to train the ASR model in stage: `4`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   module load cuda/10.2.0 cudnn mkl
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 4 --stop_stage 4
   ```
5. Request computational resources and perform decoding in stage: `5`
   * Parameter `nj` in this stage's code represents the number of CPUs used to parallelly decode each recognition set: validation, test splits. So we must request 2x`nj` number of CPUs in total.
   * Note that for each CPU, we can request a maximum memory of 2000M.
   * Request RM-shared node resources for decoding:
   ```bash
   sbatch -t 12:00:00 -p RM-shared -N 1 --cpus-per-task=16 --mem=32000M decode_model.sh
   ```
   * Preview of `decode_model.sh` file to decode the ASR model in stage: `5`
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   cd /ocean/projects/cis210027p/<user>/espnet/egs/an4/asr1
   ./run.sh --stage 5 --stop_stage 5
   ```
6. Misc.
   * An interrupted training can be resumed by specifying `--resume` parameter with the path to most recent snapshot in `exp/train_nodev_pytorch_train_mtlalpha1.0/results/` directory.
   * A unique tag for managing your experiments can be set by specifying `--lmtag` and `--tag` parameters.
   * Multi-GPU training can be done by specifying `--ngpu` in the training stages.
   * For interactive debugging purposes, `srun` command can be used to request GPU-shared or RM-shared nodes as below. Note that PSC has limited service units (SUs), so use `srun` based debugging for only the required duration.
   ```bash
   srun --pty -p GPU-shared -N 1 --gpus=v100-16:1 /bin/bash -l
   srun --pty -p RM-shared -N 1 --cpus-per-task=16 --mem=32000M /bin/bash -l
   ```
