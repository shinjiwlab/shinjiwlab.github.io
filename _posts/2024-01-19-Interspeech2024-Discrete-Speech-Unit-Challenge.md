### The Challenge Overview

Description here
--->

## Introduction

In conventional speech processing approaches, models typically take either raw waveforms or high-dimensional features derived from these waveforms as input. For instance, spectral speech features continue to be widely employed, while learning-based deep neural network features have gained prominence in recent years. A promising alternative arises in the form of discrete speech representation, where speech signals within a temporal window can be represented by a single index $d$ within a range $K$: $d \in \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$.

Three challenging tasks are proposed for using discrete speech representations. 
1. Automatic speech recognition (ASR): We will evaluate the ASR performance of the proposed systems on the proposed data.
2. Text-to-speech (TTS): We will evaluate the quality of the generated speech.
3. Singing voice synthesis (SVS): We will evaluate the quality of the synthesized singing voice.


Participation is open to all. Each team can participate in any task. This challenge has preliminarily been accepted as a special session for Interspeech 2024, and participants are strongly encouraged to submit papers to the special session. The focus of the special session is to promote the adoption of discrete speech representations and encourages novel insights.

## Resources


### Baseline systems & toolkits
- [Automatic speech recognition (ASR)](https://github.com/simpleoier/espnet/tree/is2024_dsu_asr2/egs2/interspeech2024_dsu_challenge/asr2)
- [Text-to-speech (TTS)](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/tts2/egs2/ljspeech/tts2)
- [Singing voice synthesis (SVS)](https://github.com/A-Quarter-Mile/espnet/tree/tmp_muskit/egs2/opencpop/svs2)
- [Discrete vocoder training](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN)


### Track-specific dataset

- ASR: [Librispeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) and [ML-SUPERB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zslKQwadZaYWXAmfBCvlos9BVQ9k6PHT/view?usp=sharing)
- TTS: [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) and [Expresso](https://speechbot.github.io/expresso/)
- SVS: [Opencpop](https://wenet.org.cn/opencpop/)


### Data for discrete representation learning and extraction
- General Policy: There are no restrictions on using datasets for learning and extracting discrete representations. This applies broadly to all datasets.

- Specific Restrictions for Supervision Data: The key restriction is on using test sets from certain datasets for supervision in specific tasks. Specifically:
  - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): The test sets of the Librispeech and ML-SUPERB datasets cannot be used for learning the discrete representation. However, their training sets are permissible.
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS): The test sets of the LJSpeech and Expresso datasets are off-limits for discrete representation learning, but their training sets can be used.
  - Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS): The test set of the Opencpop dataset is restricted for use in discrete representation learning, though the training set is allowed.

<!-- ### Rules
* For each task, the training data must follow the baseline systems. However, there is no constraint on the data used in the foundation models.
* For submission, more details will be provided later for each task.

## Detailed tracks and rules

### ASR Challenge

* Framework: We recommend to use ESPnet for fair comparison. Feel free to let us know your preferrence.
* Evaluation metrics: Word Error Rates (WERs) on Librispeech dev/test sets and Character Error Rates (CERs) on ML-SUPERB.
* Ranking: 
  * Word/Character Error Rate: The primary method for ranking all systems is based on their Word/Character Error Rate. This metric measures the performance of a system in terms of the accuracy of the words recognized or generated compared to a reference. 
  * Efficiency of discrete tokens (bitrate): In addition to WER, the efficiency of discrete tokens in the systems will also be evaluated and ranked based on bitrate.
* Submission
  * Submission package details:
    1. The discrete speech units corresponding to the test sets in kaldi format.
    2. The predicted transcription corresponding to the test sets.
    3. A technical report in Interspeech2024 paper format (no length limit)
